initialize project: 
npm init -i
npm install cypress --save-dev

auto suggest:
/// <reference types="Cypress" />

side notes:
cypress is async by nature
non cypress methods require .then() 23, 24
non cypress method can't be chained (.text())
.then() operates 1st element vs .each() on all elements

timeouts configured in global dashboard settings / cypress.config + individual timeout can be set in it block Cypress.config

this.data = data in fixtures - corresponds to the whole file, allows to use data outside the scope of a function

Root Cause:
• In JavaScript, function() creates its own this context, while the arrow function => inherits the surrounding context.
• You are using function(data) in the before hook and trying to access this.data later, which won’t work as intended.

avoid assertions in page object files

it will overridee the code url:
npx cypress run --spec path --env url=

cypress dashboard - log in and configure the project
configuration - spec pattern - which tests to run

js - var can be redeclared and let cant
